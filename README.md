# Adaptive-traffic-signal-control-RL
A Machine Learning project using Reinforcement Learning to optimize adaptive traffic signal control, reducing congestion and improving urban traffic flow.

üö¶ Adaptive Traffic Signal Controlling using Reinforcement Learning

üìç Overview
This project aims to optimize urban traffic management using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The system dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic density, improving flow efficiency and reducing waiting time.

üß† Objectives
- Implement Reinforcement Learning for smart traffic control.
- Reduce average vehicle waiting time at intersections.
- Integrate with SUMO simulation for realistic testing.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
**Python**
 **SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)**
 **TraCI (Traffic Control Interface)**
**YOLO for vehicle detection** **Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy**

üß© Architecture
- The model takes live traffic data (vehicle counts per lane).
- RL agent learns optimal actions (signal timing decisions).
- SUMO simulation provides feedback for each action.

üßæ Summary
This project demonstrates a real-world implementation of AI in traffic management.  
It combines Reinforcement Learning, SUMO simulation, and automation control to enable smart traffic systems.  
Developed as part of a 2-month Data Science and Machine Learning internship at Infotact Solutions by Kritika Mehra.
